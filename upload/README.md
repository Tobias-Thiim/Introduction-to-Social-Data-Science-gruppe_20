The files here contain our Exam. 

The data files are as follows:

'boliger_salg.parquet', 'jobs.parquet' and 'station_data.csv' contain the datasets as they looked when they were scraped / accessed via API. 

The 'TT_Vesrion_Eksamen_Notebook' together with the 'EKSAMEN_upload.py' takes the reader through the cleaning process and merging process. 

Out of this comes the final dataset, ready for machine learning, which can also be downloaded straight, using 'ML_Dataset.parquet'. 

Descriptive stats are calculated in 'Descriptive statistik af samlet' 

The following notebooks then run the machine learning models:

'ML LASSO', 'ML LASSO - simpel', 'ML Ridge', 'ML Ridge - simpel', 'Elastic_net_ren' 'Exam_Upload_RandomForest'
